Canopy: FPGA-Accelerated Deep Learning Compiler Stack
===

## Introduction

Canopy is an evolved version of Apache TVM developed by 4Paradigm. TVM is an open-source deep learning compiler stack that supports a variety of hardware backends, such as CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. However, the supported FPGA is only limited to SoC FPGAs with the shared memory space between an ARM core and FPGA. Based on such a hardware architecture, modern high-end PCIE-based cloud FPGAs cannot take advantage from TVM because of the separate memory space between the host and FPGA. Therefore, the major purpose of Canopy project is to enable the open-source deep learning compiler stack to run efficiently on PCIE-based high-end FPGAs. Compared with TVM, there are three major contributions:

- We have designed the PCIE driver to adapt to the TVM framework, which makes it possible to work with PCIE-based FPGA cards.
- We have defined and implemented the underlying FPGA-based accelerator using high-level synthesis languages OpenCL. Therefore, any hardware accelerators with OpenCL support can be integrated into Canopy with minimum code modification efforts.
- We have extended and fixed a few issues from TVM to make it support FPGA smoothly.

As a result, Canopy is able to compile and run deep learning models on PCIE-based high-end FPGAs. Our design supports both Intel and Xilinx's FPGAs, and has been tested on Intel Arria 10, Stratix 10, and AWS F1 instances (with Xilinx Virtex UltraScale+).

`Note that we have open-sourced the baseline version of Canopy. For any commercial supports, customized design, and further improvement, please contact 4Paradigm: LU Mian lumian@4paradigm.com`

## Contribution to Apache TVM

This repository is forked from Apache TVM (https://github.com/apache/tvm). We greatly appreciate the significant work done by the TVM team that has defined a neat but yet flexible design for deep learning compiler and accelerator research. Meanwhile, we have been contributing most of our work into the TVM community. To understand what we have proposed to the TVM community, please refer to the following RFC and discussion.

- https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-vta-support-for-cloud-devices-opencl-compatible/6676
- https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/5840

According to the RFC, we have submitted tens of PRs to the TVM community (dated Dec 2020) and more ongoing.

`However, a more efficient hardware design as well as the Xilinx FPGA support are included only in this repository. We strongly recommend you to start your evaluation on AWS EC2 F1 instances as following, which is easy to develop, compile, and deploy your models.`
